        <h1>Fifth Generation</h1>
        <p> Fifth generation computers are in developmental stage which is based on the artificial intelligence. The goal of the fifth generation is to develop the device which could respond to natural language input and are capable of learning and self-organization. Quantum computation and molecular and nanotechnology will be used in this technology.The term "fifth generation" was intended to convey the system as being a leap beyond existing machines. In the history of computing hardware, computers using vacuum tubes were called the first generation; transistors and diodes, the second; integrated circuits, the third; and those using microprocessors, the fourth. Whereas previous computer generations had focused on increasing the number of logic elements in a single CPU, the fifth generation, it was widely believed at the time, would instead turn to massive numbers of CPUs for added performance. The fifth generation computers are still in development. Scientists are working on fifth generation computers. The main aim of fifth generation computing is to develop computers that are respond to surroundings using different types of sensors and capable of learning. Fifth generation computers use super large scale integrated (SLSI) chips that contains millions of components on a single chip.
        These computers use parallel processing where instructions are executed in parallel manner. Parallel processing is much faster than serial processing. In serial processing each task is performed in serial manner. Where as in parallel processing multiple tasks are performed simultaneously. Fifth generation computers are based on artificial intelligence. The fifth generation computers are also called artificial intelligence computers.<p>
        <H2> AI: Artificial Intelligence</h2>
        <P>Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that aims to create intelligent machines. It has become an essential part of the technology industry.Knowledge engineering is a core part of AI research. Machines can often act and react like humans only if they have abundant information relating to the world. Artificial intelligence must have access to objects, categories, properties and relations between all of them to implement knowledge engineering. Initiating common sense, reasoning and problem-solving power in machines is a difficult and tedious task.
        Machine learning is also a core part of AI. Learning without any kind of supervision requires an ability to identify patterns in streams of inputs, whereas learning with adequate supervision involves classification and numerical regressions. Classification determines the category an object belongs to and regression deals with obtaining a set of numerical input or output examples, thereby discovering functions enabling the generation of suitable outputs from respective inputs. Mathematical analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a well-defined branch of theoretical computer science often referred to as computational learning theory.
        Machine perception deals with the capability to use sensory inputs to deduce the different aspects of the world, while computer vision is the power to analyze visual inputs with a few sub-problems such as facial, object and gesture recognition.</P>
