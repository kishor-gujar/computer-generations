        <h1>Third Generation</h1>
        <p>Third generation computers were computers that emerged due to the development of the integrated circuit (IC). They were the first steps toward computers as we know them today. Their main feature was the use of integrated circuits, which allowed them to be shrunk down to be as small as large toasters. Because of this, they gained the name microcomputers because compared to second generation computers which would occupy entire rooms and buildings, they were quite small. Well-known computers in this generation include the DEC PDP series and the IBM-360 series computers.
        Third generation computers were developed around 1964 to 1971, though different sources contradict each other by one or two years. The third generation was brought about by advances in the manufacture of transistors; scientists and engineers where able to make transistors smaller and smaller, which led to entire circuits fitting onto a single piece of silicon, now known as the integrated circuit or microchip. This revolutionized computing, as it was now possible to create smaller, cheaper computers that were multitudes faster than pre-microchip era computers.Transistors were miniaturized and placed on silicon chips, called semiconductors, which drastically increased the speed and efficiency of computers.
        Keyboards and monitors developed during the period of third generation of computers. The third generation computers interfaced with an operating system, which allowed the device to run many different applications at one time with a central program that monitored the memory.</P>
        <h2> Introduction to High-level Programming languages</h2>
        <p>Suddenly computers became more affordable, and soon programmers and technology enthusiasts became more numerous, leading to further developments in the field of computer programming as well as in computer hardware.3GLs are much more machine independent and more programmer-friendly. This includes features like improved support for aggregate data types, and expressing concepts in a way that favors the programmer, not the computer. A third generation language improves over a second generation language by having the computer take care of non-essential details. 3GLs are more abstract than previous generations of languages, and thus can be considered higher level languages than their first and second generation counterparts.  It was during this time that many high-level programming languages were gaining widespread use, programming languages such as C, Pascal, COBOL and FORTRAN. Magnetic storage also became more popular in this era. These languages were much better and could represent more information. Consequently more and more complex calculations are possible.</p>
        <h3> IBM-360 </h3>
        <p>In 1964, the IBM System/360 was announced by International Business Machines Corporations. It contained custom hybrid integrated circuits, worked with 32-bit words, and used 360 assembly language. It was this computer that processed data concerning lunar landings at NASA. Its mainframe could run programs of earlier systems, making it more useful and valuable. It and its succeeding models were ultimately a huge impact on the computer world in terms of workload and power.</p>
        <h3> UNIVAC 1108 </h3>
        <p>The UNIVAC 1108 was introduced in 1964. Integrated circuits replace the thin film memory for register storage. They contained smaller and faster cores for main memory of the UNIVAC 1107. In the end, 296 were produced. In 1969, an identical machine was produced; the UNIVAC 1106. It was slower but cheaper for its customers. A alternate memory system that wasn't as expensive or efficient was used in it.</p>
        <H3> Characteristics </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>IC was used instead of transistors in the third generation computers.</li>
            <li>Third generation computers were smaller in size and cheaper as compare to the second generation computers.</li>
            <li>They were fast and more reliable.</li>
            <li>They used High level language which were Easy.</li>
            <li>Magnetic core and solid states as main storage.</li>
            <li>They were able to reduce computational time and had low maintenance cost.</li>
            <li>Input/Output devices became more sophisticated.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Examples</h3>
        Examples of the third generation computers include IBM-360 series, Honeywell-6000 series, PDP (Personal Data Processor),  and IBM-370/168.
