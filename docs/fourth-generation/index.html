        <h1>Fourth Generation</h1>
        <p>The microprocessor brought the fourth generation of computers, as thousands of integrated circuits were built onto a single silicon chip. What in the first generation filled an entire room could now fit in the palm of the hand. The Intel 4004 chip, developed in 1971, located all the components of the computer—from the central processing unit and memory to input/output controls—on a single chip.
        In 1981 IBM introduced its first computer for the home user, and in 1984 Apple introduced the Macintosh. Microprocessors also moved out of the realm of desktop computers and into many areas of life as more and more everyday products began to use microprocessors.
        As these small computers became more powerful, they could be linked together to form networks, which eventually led to the development of the Internet. Fourth generation computers also saw the development of GUIs, the mouse and handheld devices.</p>
        <h2> ALTAIR 8800:The First Personal Computer</h2>
        <p>MITS' ALTAIR 8800 is credited as one of the first microcomputers. It was produced in 1975 by Micro Instrumentation Telemetry Systems labeled as a personal computer; PC. Ed Roberts, the head of MITS, designed it using a Intel 8080 CPU chip (first 16- bit microprocessor)  and a sleek metal case. Once a monitor and keyboard were sold with it, the sales increased greatly. It was the initial influence of personal computing in the world. You could run BASIC language on it, written by Bill Gates and Paul Allen sold as "Altair BASIC" which became their company's, Microsoft's, first product. The computer sold very well for an amount of time, but then, MITS was sold to a company called Pertec in 1976. The ALTAIR seemed to disappear into history.</P>
        <h2> The Beginning of Microsoft</h2>
        <p>The founders of Microsoft, Paul Allen and Bill Gates, began working with computers by writing BASIC in a partnership with MITS for the ALTAIR 8800. They thought of the name micro-soft as in "Microprocessing Software." They started out with mostly making operating systems and programming languages. DOS, Disk Operating System, brought in much success for the company. A partnership with IBM lead to the release of the IBM PC DOS in 1981. The company upheld many other collaborations, creating systems for different computers during that era. 
        In 1985, they released a retail version of Windows 1.0, a 16- bit graphical operating environment. They also released a operating system called OS/2 with IBM, which was quite successful. A program for word processing, database, and spreadsheet was also released, which was named Microsoft Works in 1986. As the release of Windows 3.0 came about, OS/2 sales greatly declined, and Microsoft abandoned the partnership with IBM. They began the transition from MS-DOS to Windows. "Microsoft Windows" truly became its own computer company.</P>
