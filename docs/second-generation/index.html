        <h1>Second Generation</h1>
        <div class="flex-container">
            <p class="info">During the period of 1956 to 1963 second generation of computers were developed. The second generation computers emerged with development of Transistors. The transistor was invented in 1947 by three scientists J. Bardeen, H.W. Brattain and W. Shockley. A transistor is a small device made up of semiconductor material like germanium and silicon. Even though the Transistor were developed in 1947 but was not widely used until the end of 50s.The transistor was far superior to the vacuum tube, allowing computers to become smaller, faster, cheaper, more energy-efficient and more reliable than their first-generation predecessors. Though the transistor still generated a great deal of heat that subjected the computer to damage, it was a vast improvement over the vacuum tube. Second-generation computers still relied on punched cards for input and printouts for output.</p>

        <h2>Binary To Assembly Language</h2>
        <p>Second generation computers used the low level language i.e. machine level language and assembly language which made the programmers easier to specify the instructions. Later on High level language programming were introduced such as COBOL and FORTRAN. Magnetic core was used as primary storage. Second generation computer has faster input /output devices which thus brought improvement in the computer. The first computers of this generation were developed for the atomic energy industry.</P>
        <h3> IBM 1401</h3>
        <P>IBM produced the IBM 1401, initially as a card processor but later added memory to become their smallest one in th erange. The IBM 7000 series was the larger second generation machine range. Many other manufacturers produced computers at the time: it was the coming of 3rd generation machines that the number of suppliers shrank due to the expense of developing a whole new series of machines every few years. This also covered the growth in computer applications which could not be run on competing hardware, so unlesss a manufacturer invested heavily in software, they couldnâ€™t sell enough of them - apart from the Defense departments.<p/>
